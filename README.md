- 👋 Hi, I’m @sebug
- 👀 I’m interested in making people's lives better in small ways with the code I write.
- 🌱 I'm always toying around with Serverless and consumption-based technologies because I don't have the money to permahost all the things that come into my mind. I did a lot of cryptographic stuff with C# / .NET recently.
- 💞️ I don't yet know whether I have the brain space to collaborate on anything, but I may start contributing a bit more.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@sebug)
