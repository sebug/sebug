- 👋 Hi, I’m @sebug
- 👀 I’m interested in making people's lives better in small ways with the code I write.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning QLoRA finetuning of models for specialized tasks. I don't know whether I like the direction the industry is going, but am intent on finding a not harmful use case of natural language to query language transformation
- 💞️ I don't yet know whether I have the brain space to collaborate on anything, but I may start contributing a bit more.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@sebug)
